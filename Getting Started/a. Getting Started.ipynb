    "Open cv library defines **imread()** for reading the images saved on the disk. It usually takes two arguments. First is Image path, where the image should be in the working directory or the full qualified name of the path should be provided. Second argument is the flag which which specifies the way image should be read. The flags are ***IMREAD_COLOR (default), IMREAD_GRAYSCALE and IMREAD_UNCHANGED***, the flags are integer values, so instead of passing the name only 1,0 or -1 can be passsed respectively."
